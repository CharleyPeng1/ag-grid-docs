        <div class="quote-text">"We’re using ag-Grid as a major component in our enterprise analytics and reporting product and it’s incredible. Prior to ag-Grid, we tried jqGrid, jqxGrid, DataTables, and SlickGrid, which all have their strong points, but we eventually ran into a wall with certain features. ag-Grid’s grouping, aggregation, filtering, and all-around flexibility allowed us to quickly integrate it into our product. And, the performance is truly awesome!"</div>
